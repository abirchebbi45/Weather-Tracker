# Weather Tracker

## Project Name: Weather Tracker

### Description:
Weather Tracker is a dynamic web application that allows users to get real-time weather updates and forecasts for their current location or a searched city. The app fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap and displays essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times. Additionally, it provides a 5-day weather forecast and displays different weather icons based on the current conditions, such as rain, snow, sun, clouds, mist, or haze.

The app also generates dynamic visual effects, like falling rain, snow, or clouds, to enhance the user experience based on the current weather condition.
